## Improvements

### Plane names

There are some plane names that are used by more than one nation. The query to retrieve the correct plane will need to include the nation with the plane name. The nation will have to be available in the select element's options.

### Filter Planes

There are alot of planes. It would be useful to add some filtering mechanism.

I've done something similar before in my [Ships of trafalgar](https://github.com/tomahawk-jupiter/ships-of-trafalgar) project.
